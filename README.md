# File upload service

## Introduction

A service built with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to upload and download files to/from a storage service.

The service performs the following actions on the uploaded files:

- validation
- virus scanning
- file conversion - if a virus is not found and the file is an image or a pdf then a clean version is created by converting the file into a different format twice
- extracting text with ocr - valid files for ocr are: for .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe, .tiff, .tif, .bmp, .pnm and .jfif
- saving into storage - 3 file versions (`orig`, `clean` and `ocr`) are saved for most images and pdfs, 2 file versions (`orig` and `clean`) are saved for all other file types - currently S3 is supported
